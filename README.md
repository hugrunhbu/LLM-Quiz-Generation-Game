An interactive quiz game where you ask the LLM to create quizzes on a specific topic or a realm of topics. Generates 4 different solutions and you get points by picking the right answer.
(later the idea is to turn this into a multiplayer game where the LLM generates questions about a specific user, that user selects the most correct answer out of the 4 options and the other players guess which answer that specific player chose)
